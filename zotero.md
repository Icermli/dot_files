# Zotero Config

I use the following zotero configs
(It would be nice to locate the config files and sync them):

1. Preferences --> Advanced --> Files and Folders. Under "Linked Attachment Base Directory",
   change "Base directory" to `~/Dropbox/Zotero_Library`.

2. Log in my Zotero account for Data Syncing.

3. Install add-on [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/).

4. Tools --> ZotFile Preferences --> General Settings. Set "Locations of Files' to be
   `~/Dropbox/Zotero_Library` and use subfolder defined by `%a_%y_%t_{%s|%w}`.

5. For tablet file management, go to Tools --> ZotFile Preferences --> Tablet Settings.
   Check "use ZotFile to send and get files from tablet". Set `Base Folder` to be the 
   icloud/Dropbox folder of choice. Also check "Save copy of annotated file with suffix",
   and leave the rest as default.
